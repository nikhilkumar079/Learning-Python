## RoboSpeaker Project
The RoboSpeaker project is a simple Python program that converts text to speech. The program uses the built-in OS module to generate the speech, and allows the user to input any text they want to be spoken.

## Getting Started
To get started with the RoboSpeaker project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
Once you have Python, you can download or clone the RoboSpeaker project to your local machine.

## How to Use
To use the RoboSpeaker program, simply run the robo_speaker.py file in your Python interpreter. You will be prompted to enter the text you want the system to speak. Once you enter the text and press enter, the system will begin speaking your text.
