    "The main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Labeled vs. unlabeled data: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means the data is already tagged with the correct answer or output. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, which means the data does not have any predefined outputs or labels. Semi-supervised learning falls in between these two categories, as it involves training on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Task type: Supervised learning is used for tasks such as classification, regression, and prediction, where the algorithm learns to predict a target variable based on input features. Unsupervised learning is used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, where the algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships in data without any predefined output or label. Semi-supervised learning can be used for both types of tasks, but it is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance evaluation: In supervised learning, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on its ability to predict the correct output on a set of test data that is separate from the training data. In unsupervised learning, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on metrics such as cluster quality, anomaly detection, or dimensionality reduction. Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of both supervised and unsupervised evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity: Supervised learning algorithms tend to be more complex and require more computational resources than unsupervised learning algorithms, as they need to learn from labeled examples. Unsupervised learning algorithms are generally simpler and require less data preprocessing, but they may be more challenging to interpret and validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data availability: Supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain in some cases. Unsupervised learning algorithms can work with unlabeled data, which is often easier to obtain in larger quantities. Semi-supervised learning can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, making it more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios."
