    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans. Since the class is just a blueprint, self allows access to the attributes and methods of each object in python. This allows each object to have its own attributes and methods. Thus, even long before creating these objects, we reference the objects as self while defining the class."
