# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Introduction
This is a brief guide on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) intended for beginners who are interested in analyzing data. EDA is a technique used by data scientists to summarize and visualize datasets to get insights and draw conclusions. It is the first step in any data analysis project and helps to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables.
Here, different data sets are used in order to understand EDA.

# Getting Started
Before starting EDA, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the dataset that you are working on. This includes understanding the data types, the distribution of data, and any missing values. It is also helpful to have a clear idea of the research questions you want to answer.

# EDA Techniques

There are several techniques that can be used in EDA, including:

Univariate analysis: This involves analyzing one variable at a time to get an understanding of its distribution, central tendency, and spread. Histograms, box plots, and bar charts are some of the visualizations that can be used for univariate analysis.

Bivariate analysis: This involves analyzing the relationship between two variables. Scatter plots, heatmaps, and line charts are some of the visualizations that can be used for bivariate analysis.

Multivariate analysis: This involves analyzing more than two variables simultaneously. This can be done using correlation matrices, scatterplot matrices, and parallel coordinate plots.

# EDA Tools
There are several tools that can be used for EDA, including:

Python: Python is a popular programming language for data analysis and has several libraries, such as Pandas and Seaborn, which are useful for EDA.

R: R is another popular programming language for data analysis, and has several libraries, such as ggplot2 and dplyr, which are useful for EDA.

Excel: Excel is a spreadsheet software that can be used for basic EDA.

Tableau: Tableau is a data visualization software that can be used for advanced EDA.

# Conclusion
EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis project and helps to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables. There are several techniques and tools that can be used for EDA, and the choice of technique and tool depends on the data and research questions.
